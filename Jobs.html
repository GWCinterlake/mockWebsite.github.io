          <p>2. <b><em>Have a stromg resume.</em></b> This paper is usually the first thing a potential employer will see first, especially if you are applying online. Here are a few good resume-building websites: </p>

            <p>It is a good idea to list action verbs when describing your job and limiting yourself to 1 page. Highlight important factors that set you apart from the rest.</p>
          <p>3. <b><em>Stand out.</em></b> Make you interview memorable. Try to connect with the interviewer more so they can connect a person to a resume. This boosts the chance of getting hired because you are no longer a piece of paper, but you become a person in their mind.</p>
          <p>4. <b><em>Make the first move.</em></b> If you are interested in working for a certain corporation, don't be afraid to call in and ask if they are hiring and send them a copy of your resume. This shows you are engaged and an enthusiastic candidate.</p>
          <p>5. <b><em>Use online job searching websites.</em></b> These are minefields of jobs that companies are seeking to fill. It is very easy to send in a resume and establishes an easy line of communication. Some good ones are <a href="https://www.indeed.com/">https://www.indeed.com/</a> or even <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">https://www.linkedin.com/</a>.</p>
          <p>6. <b><em>Stay in touch, but don't force it.</em></b> A good benchmark for calling back is 2 days. If you contact someone and they don't respond, call or email back in 2 days. If nothing after that, let it go. Some job matches aren't meant to be.</p>
          <p>7. <b><em>Always take criticism post-interview.</em></b> This will help you prepare and perform better at your next interview. Some interviewers will offer a debreif even if you did not get an offer, and this will help you in your search for another job as well as make your interview more memorable. This might benefit you when interviewing for another job with the company.</p>
          <p>8. <b><em>Know the industry jargon and slang.</em></b> This is very difficult to do if you are just entering into a new industry, but this will help demonstrate your competency and understanding of the skills needed to work proficiently. Taking some quick online courses to learn the terminology.</p>
          <p>9. <b><em>Dress appropriately.</em></b> It is better to be over-dressed than under-dressed. If a corporation has a business casual attire, it would be good to come in wearing business casual or business clothes. </p>
          <p>10. <b><em>Be punctual.</em></b> Always give yourself around 15 minutes extra to get there on time. Especially if it is in a new place where you must find parking, find the building, and find the office, it is important to allocate for that time. First impressions are one of the most important ones, and being on time will greatly help with that.</p>
