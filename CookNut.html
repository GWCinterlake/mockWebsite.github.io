        <center><h3>Nutrition</h3></center>
        <p>Everyone always says, "You are what you eat." And yet, so many young children eat junk food and food that does not satisfy their needs. Many people binge eat, starve themselves, or count calories ineffectively. It is important to stay healthy, and the best way to do that is to eat right. The three main food substances are: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. It is important to get a balance of all three of these.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect">
        <h4>Carbohydrates</h4>
        <p>Many people say they refuse to eat carbohydrates because they make them fat. This is absolutely not true. When you don't eat your carbs, the first thing the body burns for energy is muscle. The body needs carbohydrates to function and provide energy to build up muscles.</p>
        <p>Now, this isn't to say that it is ok to binge-eat carbs. It is true that eating less carbs will help lose weight faster, but this does not mean to abstain. For a 2000 calorie diet it is suggested to eat from 225-325 g of carbs every day.</p>
        <p>The best carbohydrates to eat are the least processed. Oats, rice, grapes, bananas and other such natural carbs are the healthiest because they have been less processed, thus holding your hunger longer and fueling you with more nutrients.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect">
        <h4>Fats</h4>
        <p>Also known as lipids, this is the food group that is most commonly stored in the body. It provides a layer of insulation for the body and also composes a lot of your body's cells. It is important to have enough fat to function properly. Sometimes, a body will shut of a process, in the case of women usually being ovulation, if a person's bdoy fat percentage dips too low.</p>
        <p>It is imperative to know the value of good fats, such as omega 3's and avocado oil and such. These are valuable fats, unlike trans and saturated fat like butter that tends to build up in the body. Too much buildup may lead to heart failure, blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect">
        <h4>Protein</h4>
        <p>Protein is the heaviest stored food element, despite it taking up much less space than fat. Proteins are the building blocks of muscle, allowing us to walk and run and move. It is imortant to consume enough proteins to have adequate muscle mass, but eating too much protein can actually force the body to store the proteins in fat.</p>
        <p>It is also very important to eat the right types of protein. The less processed and leaner, the better. This is why it is better to eat plant protein, such as beans. Fish protein also has healthy fat, omega-3. Chicken and turkey are white meats that are leaner. Red meat, such as  beef or pork, tends to store more saturated fat.</p>

          <h4>Pasta</h4>
            <p>Most times, you can find directions on the back of the container you bought the pasta in.</p>
            <p>1. Boil water in a large pot. Sprinkle in a little salt for taste.</p>
            <p>2. Put in the pasta.</p>
            <p>3. Let the pasta cook in the boiling water for 10 minutes. Stir about every 2 minutes. Keep the pot lid off to prevent overspilling.</p>
            <p>4. Once the pasta is soft and fully cooked, take the pot off the heat.</p>
            <p>5. Drain the pasta by putting the lid on at an angle, catching the pasta but letting the water drain out.</p>
            <p>6. Add a little olive oil or butter into the pasta.</p>
            <p>7. Top with your favorite marinara or alfredo sauce, or with mushrooms, tomatoes, or parsley</p>
            <p>8. Serve warm</p>

          <h4>Avocado Salad</h4>
            <p>1. Take a ripe avocado and take the skin and pit out</p>
            <p>2. Dice the avocado and add into a big bowl</p>
            <p>3. Dice up some cucumber and add into the bowl</p>
            <p>4. Chop up 1/4 of an onion and add in</p>
            <p>5. Take a big tomato and dice it, adding it into the bowl</p>
            <p>6. Chop up some cilantro and add it in</p>
            <p>7. Add a little bit of vegetable oil and some balsamic vinegar</p>
            <p>8. Add lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste</p>
